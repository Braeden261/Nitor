1,1,1,1,"Oh dear, another wounded lamb, come under my wing. Heh Heh Heh…."
2,1,1,2,"This sanctuary is a home to those who have lost themselves, unable to return to the land above."
3,1,1,3,"Oh? You want to go back? Are you sure, there is nothing but suffering up there. Down here we can live in relative peace, what do you say?"
4,1,1,4,No?
5,1,1,5,"If you insist on going, then there is nothing I can do to stop you, but if it be thy will to help us here, bring me the life essence of those you cut down."
6,1,1,6,"This essence is useful fuel to our fires, therefore allowing life in these Depths to continue."
7,1,1,7,"For now I can bestow upon you a gift. One heralding from a God of old, a God of sunlight, from when this land was once a powerful kingdom which harnessed the sun."
8,1,1,8,Go talk to the Young Doctor. She can give you some supplies for your upcoming journey. And don’t forget to pray at the altars…
9,1,1,9,"You will find these altars throughout the land, abandoned. Return life to them by praying at them."
10,1,1,10,Hm...I see something in you…
11,1,1,11,"…Anyhow, the altars may prove useful to you, so pray at them as you see fit."
12,1,1,12,I’m sure we will see you again soon.
13,1,1,13,Heh Heh Heh…
14,1,2,1,"Speak with the Young Doctor, then be on your way."
15,1,2,2,…
16,1,3,1,I see....
17,1,3,2,"You’ve taken on a guardian of sorts, resurrecting you upon death. This spirit is one of old, one of legend."
18,1,3,3,"But this is assuredly unnecessary information for you, as you seek only revenge. The means as to how you get there is trivial yes?"
19,1,3,4,"Heed this warning though. Do not take for granted the gift bestowed upon you, and do not question the one who provides it."
20,1,3,5,....
21,1,3,6,Is there something that you wanted to discuss?
22,1,4,1,"Welcome back, oh motivated one."
23,1,4,2,Do you have wares of which you would like to trade?
24,1,5,1,I see you’ve found the Gatekeeper.
25,1,5,2,"She was once a great Knight of this land, the land of Sun and Prosperity."
26,1,5,3,"Those damned cultists invaded, destroyed everything, killed everyone... well almost everyone."
27,1,5,4,"Her and her legion protected the kingdom’s throne room far past when the rest of the kingdom surrendered, but alas they were destroyed."
28,1,5,5,"Her armor remains, filled with the hatred of her and her legion, bound to protect the throne room for all eternity."
29,1,5,6,A fine battle…
30,1,5,7,Heh Heh Heh….
31,1,6,1,So you laid her to rest….finally.
32,1,6,2,She deserved an honourable death and you have finally provided her with that.
33,1,6,3,Thank You.
34,1,7,1,So you finally made it back up top?
35,1,7,2,"And your journey, finally coming to a close."
36,1,7,3,"Understand that by killing that man, you will be creating a state of anarchy and despair. Is this something that you’re prepared to do?"
37,1,7,4,Will you take his place?
38,1,7,5,Only time will tell…
39,1,7,6,Heh Heh Heh…
40,1,8,1,Back again?
41,1,8,2,Do you have more life essence that we could partake in?
42,1,9,1,Leaving so soon?
43,1,9,2,Heh...I expect we’ll be seeing you again shortly.
44,2,1,1,Hello There.
45,2,1,2,You can bring me empty sun vessels to increase your healing potential.
46,2,1,3,Do You have any sun vessels for me?
